# The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)

This repository contains my code, notes, and exercises from The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)
 by Andrew Mead.
The course covers everything from the basics of Node.js to building and deploying real-world applications.

## Course Overview
The course is project-based and teaches Node.js through practical examples.
It includes topics such as:
- Node.js fundamentals
- Asynchronous programming
- File system & command line tools
- NPM & package management
- REST APIs with Express
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- Authentication & security
- Testing & debugging
- Deployment to production (Heroku)

## Projects in This Repository
- Throughout the course, I worked on several hands-on projects:
- Notes App - A command line app for creating and managing notes.
- Weather App - Fetches real-time weather data using APIs.
- Task Manager API - A full REST API with CRUD operations, authentication, and MongoDB integration.
- Chat App - A real-time chat application using Socket.io.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- Socket.io
- NPM
- Jest (for testing)
